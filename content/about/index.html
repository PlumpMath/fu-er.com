<h2 class="about_title">> p Info</h2>

<p>
I am a coder on the outside, artist on the inside, trying to turn inside out. This website is step one of my metamorphosis. One day, I will emerge as a fantastical hybrid with ten thousand hours of passion-fueled experience in my pocket. Until then, I will continue to refine my skill one step at a time.
