My first idea for a site header: 3 giant gods looming over a rectangular cross-section of earth. The first image below shows the initial idea, which I iterated on with more realistic whale references, and a more elaborate tiki mask for the sun god. I had an idea to replace the tree god with a stork (god of life) that is puking up tons of creatures. I may revisit this piece in the future.
