This is a spaceship designed for a class project. It started from sketches of symmetrical spaceships; The objective was to put the ship in perspective and learn about the methods of measuring points to ensure symmetry. After the general structure looks right in perspective, we were free to add details. I did an initial quick sketch, and turned everything into clean vector lines in Illustrator.
