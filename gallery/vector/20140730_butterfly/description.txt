<p>This is a tattoo design for some awesome friends. The request was a pair of asymmetrical butterfly wings made of cogs. One wing will be good and pure, the other dark and evil. I started with a design made by <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alchemyprodigy.net/">Jo</a>, as shown in the first image below. Next few images show sketches and improvements made from feedback, and then final line work. The colors will be made tattoo-friendly somewhere down the pipeline.</p>
