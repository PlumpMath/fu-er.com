This is a work in progress of a tattoo design for some very cool friends. The idea behind it is a pair of asymmetrical butterfly wings made of cogs. One wing will be good and pure, the other dark and evil. I started with a design made by my good friend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.alchemyprodigy.net/">Jo</a>, as shown in the first image below. Next few images show sketches and improvements made from feedback, and tentative final line work. Next iteration will be to distinguish the wings more, and after that, final colors! I have splayed some annoying watermarks over the whole thing for now, please bare with that.
