This is a view of my humble little apartment done for perspective class. The process is shown below; starting from a sketch, putting figures in for consistent sizing, and then making clean polished line in Illustrator. The feedback was to finish the composition (put more things on the wall), and to widen my vanishing points even more (the sink is falling off the bottom). I may revisit this and work on the former point some day. Check out the rad keyboard!
