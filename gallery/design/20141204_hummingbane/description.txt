<p>This is a creature/plant redesign project that was done for Dynamic Sketching 1 at CGMA. The main purpose of this assignment is to explore the design process by considering a creature's function, environment, and interdependencies. I began with the idea of a carnivorous plant that preys upon hummingbirds.</p>
<p>The design and iteration process is shown below. First, I did some silhouette studies to determine the overall creature shape and size. Its trapping and feeding method is then organically incorporated into the flowers and roots. There is also brief indication of its reproduction by budding (because I find a coil of tentacles to be really charming). Finally, I also did some sketches of hummingbird bones and scavanging insects to scatter around the environment, implying its place in the food chain and completing the full image.</p>
