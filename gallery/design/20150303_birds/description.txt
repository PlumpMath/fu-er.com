<p>Some silhouette studies done for Dynamic Sketching 2 at CGMA. The main objective is to explore the three main shapes (triangle, circle, square) in silhouettes. I chose a wide range of birds to be my main subjects, and, to tie things together, created a social hierarchy for them to co-exist in. It does imply that all these birds of various shapes and sizes spawn from the same queen-bird. I like that. The last page shows some hybrids (hybirds).</p>
