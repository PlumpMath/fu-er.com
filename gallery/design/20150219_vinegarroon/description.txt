A design project focused on shape exploration. The objective is to take an existing creature and break it down into simpler forms. For example, insects can be broken down into head-thorax-abdomen bean-spheres, and legs into cylinders. With these shapes identified, push their proportions to get new designs.</br>
I chose a whip scorpion and did an exploded view to study the various basic shapes. The shape exploration I did involved making the whip scorpion into a shrimp-like creature, contorting it into a dragonfly mimic, and giving it a huge abdomen (for more traditional spider nightmares).
